function GenerateAppStructure(
  app_name: string @description("Name of the app"),
  app_description: string @description("Description of what the app does"),

  prompt #"
    {{ _.role("user") }}

    You are creating a structural blueprint for an iPhone app. This plan will guide image generation, so be specific and detailed.

    **APP DETAILS:**
    - Name: {{ app_name }}
    - Description: {{ app_description }}
    - Style Guide: {{ style_guide }}
    - Number of screens: {{ num_screens }}

    **YOUR TASK:**
    Create a comprehensive app structure plan that defines:
    1. Navigation pattern (tabs or no tabs)
    2. Common layout elements across all screens
    3. Detailed plan for each of the {{ num_screens }} screens

    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

    ## 1. TAB NAVIGATION ANALYSIS

    Determine if this app should use bottom navigation tabs:
    - **Use tabs if:** App has 3-5 distinct sections users switch between frequently (e.g., social apps, e-commerce, content platforms)
    - **No tabs if:** Single-purpose utility, linear workflows, games, or simple tools

    If using tabs:
    - Choose 3-5 clear tab names (e.g., "Home", "Explore", "Messages", "Profile")
    - Describe each tab's icon (outline style, 24px size)
    - Define tab styling using colors from style_guide (active color, inactive color, positioning)

    ## 2. COMMON LAYOUT ELEMENTS

    Define elements that appear on EVERY screen:
    - Status bar style (time, battery, signal at top edge)
    - Background color (from style_guide)
    - Header patterns (if any common headers)
    - Overall spacing and margins
    - Any persistent UI elements

    ## 3. SCREEN DETAILS

    For each of the {{ num_screens }} screens, define:

    **screen_name:** Descriptive name (e.g., "Home Dashboard", "Video Chat", "Settings")

    **purpose:** What this screen accomplishes in 1-2 sentences

    **layout_type:** Choose from:
    - "dashboard" - Stats, cards, summaries, overview
    - "list" - Scrollable list of items (messages, products, articles)
    - "grid" - Grid of images/cards (photos, products, media)
    - "detail" - Single item detail view (profile, article, product page)
    - "form" - Input fields, settings, creation flows
    - "media" - Large media display (video, photo viewer)
    - "chat" - Messaging interface
    - "map" - Location-based interface

    **unique_elements:** Specific UI components for THIS screen:
    - Headers, titles, labels (with text examples)
    - Buttons and CTAs (what they say, where positioned)
    - Cards, lists, grids (what content they contain)
    - Input fields (what data they collect)
    - Images, icons, illustrations (what they depict)
    - Stats, progress bars, graphs (what metrics)
    - Be concrete and specific!

    **active_tab_index:** If using tabs, which tab (0-based index) is active on this screen? If screen doesn't map to a tab or no tabs exist, use null.

    **SCREEN VARIETY:**
    - Include diverse screen types (mix of dashboard, list, detail, form)
    - Each screen should serve a distinct purpose
    - Cover main user flows of the app
    - For {{ num_screens }} screens, typical breakdown:
      * 1-2 landing/home screens
      * 2-3 feature screens (core functionality)
      * 1 profile/account screen
      * 1 settings/preferences screen

    Generate a canvas-editing prompt for Gemini Flash to create an iPhone app screen.

    **APP CONTEXT:**
    - App Name: {{ app_name }}
    - Style Guide: {{ style_guide }}

    **COMMON LAYOUT (applies to all screens):**
    {{ common_layout }}

    **TAB NAVIGATION:**
    {% if tabs.has_tabs %}
    This app uses bottom navigation with {{ tabs.tab_names | length }} tabs:
    {% for tab_name in tabs.tab_names %}
    - Tab {{ loop.index0 }}: "{{ tab_name }}" ({{ tabs.tab_icon_descriptions[loop.index0] }})
    {% endfor %}

    Tab Styling: {{ tabs.tab_styling }}
    {% else %}
    This app does not use bottom navigation tabs.

    - Name: {{ screen_detail.screen_name }}
    - Purpose: {{ screen_detail.purpose }}
    - Layout Type: {{ screen_detail.layout_type }}
    - Unique Elements: {{ screen_detail.unique_elements }}

    - Active Tab: {{ tabs.tab_names[screen_detail.active_tab_index] }} (index {{ screen_detail.active_tab_index }})
    {% endif %}

    **IMAGE EDITING INSTRUCTIONS:**
    {% if has_reference_image %}
    You will receive TWO images:
    1. **Canvas image (image 1)**: Blank iPhone-sized canvas to edit/paint on
    2. **Reference image (image 2)**: Previously generated screen showing the visual style

    **CRITICAL:** Match the reference image's visual consistency:
    - Use the EXACT same colors for backgrounds, buttons, text
    - Match the EXACT tab bar styling (icons, colors, spacing, positioning)
    - Keep the same typography (font sizes, weights, colors)
    - Maintain the same design system (shadows, corner radius, spacing)
    - Paint onto the canvas (image 1), using reference (image 2) as your style guide

    Only change what's unique to THIS screen: content, headers, main UI elements specific to "{{ screen_detail.screen_name }}".
    {% else %}
    You will receive ONE image:
    - **Canvas image**: Blank iPhone-sized canvas to edit/paint on

    Paint the app UI directly onto this canvas based on the style guide provided above.
    {% endif %}

    **GENERATE THE PROMPT:**

    Create a complete canvas-editing prompt that:
    1. Starts with: "IMAGE EDITING TASK: The provided image is a blank iPhone-sized canvas..."
    2. Specifies the screen name: "SCREEN: {{ screen_detail.screen_name }}"
    3. Lists all UI elements to paint (from common_layout + unique_elements + tabs if applicable)
    4. Includes critical canvas-editing requirements (edge-to-edge fill, no margins, etc.)
    {% if tabs.has_tabs and screen_detail.active_tab_index is defined and screen_detail.active_tab_index is not none %}
    5. Shows the tab bar with "{{ tabs.tab_names[screen_detail.active_tab_index] }}" tab ACTIVE and all others INACTIVE
    {% elif tabs.has_tabs %}
    5. Shows the tab bar with all tabs INACTIVE (no active tab for this screen)
    {% endif %}
    6. Uses colors and styling from the style guide
    {% if has_reference_image %}
    7. Emphasizes matching the reference image's visual consistency
    {% endif %}

    Make the prompt detailed and specific with exact positioning, sizes, colors (hex codes from style_guide), and element descriptions.

    {% if screen_instructions %}
    **SCREEN REQUIREMENTS:**
    {{ screen_instructions }}
    {% else %}
    **SCREEN REQUIREMENTS:**
    Generate {{ num_screens or 5 }} diverse screens showcasing different parts of the app. Include common screens like:
    - Home/Dashboard (main entry point)
    - Main feature screen(s) specific to this app type
    - Profile/Account screen
    - Settings/Preferences screen
    - Any other relevant screens for this app's functionality

    Make each screen showcase a unique aspect of the app.
    {% endif %}

    **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - TAB COHERENCE:**

    BEFORE generating any screen prompts, follow this 3-step process:

    STEP 1 - INFER TABS (do this internally, don't output separately):
    Based on {{ app_description }}, determine if this app needs bottom navigation tabs.
    If yes, choose 4-5 appropriate tab names (e.g., "Home", "Explore", "Messages", "Profile").
    If no bottom nav makes sense (e.g., single-purpose utility apps), skip tabs entirely.

    STEP 2 - CREATE TAB TEMPLATE (memorize this for ALL screens):
    If tabs are needed, define the exact tab structure you'll use consistently:
    - Exact tab names in exact order (e.g., "Home | Discover | Library | Profile")
    - Icon style description (e.g., "24px outline icons, 1.5px stroke weight")
    - Active state styling (use ACCENT_COLOR from style guide)
    - Inactive state styling (use MUTED_COLOR derived from style guide)

    STEP 3 - GENERATE SCREENS (apply the template):
    For EACH screen prompt you generate:
    - Copy the EXACT same tab structure (same names, same order, same styling)
    - Only change which tab is ACTIVE based on the screen type
    - Example: If generating a "Profile Settings" screen, make the "Profile" tab ACTIVE
    - All other screens must show the same tabs in INACTIVE state

    **CRITICAL PROMPT REQUIREMENTS:**

    You are generating prompts for CANVAS EDITING with Gemini Flash. A blank iPhone-sized canvas image will be provided, and your prompts will instruct the model to paint UI directly onto it.

    Each prompt MUST follow this exact pattern:
    "IMAGE EDITING TASK: The provided image is a blank iPhone-sized canvas. Your task is to paint app UI directly onto THIS canvas image, completely filling it from edge to edge. DO NOT create a new image - edit the canvas image provided.

    SCREEN: [screen name]

    UI ELEMENTS TO PAINT: [Detailed UI description: specific elements like headers, buttons, cards, lists, images, text content, interactive components, with exact positioning and styling]

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR EDITING THE CANVAS:
    - Edit the provided canvas image directly - maintain its exact dimensions
    - Paint background color to fill ALL pixels of the canvas (no transparent areas)
    - Status bar elements at absolute top edge (y=0)
    - Bottom navigation bar at absolute bottom edge (y=canvas_height)
    - UI content extends to left (x=0) and right (x=canvas_width) edges
    - NO margins, NO padding around the canvas edges
    - NO device frame, NO phone mockup, NO rounded corners on the canvas itself
    - NO background extending beyond the canvas boundaries
    - The canvas dimensions ARE the final output dimensions

    STYLE GUIDE: {{ style_guide }}"

    **UI COLOR CONSISTENCY RULES (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY):**

    First, analyze the style guide "{{ style_guide }}" and identify the color palette:
    - PRIMARY_BG: The main background color (lightest or darkest base color)
    - ACCENT_COLOR: The brightest/most vibrant color for active states, primary buttons, and highlights
    - MUTED_COLOR: A softer, desaturated version for inactive states and secondary elements
    - TEXT_COLOR: High contrast color for readable text

    **MANDATORY: All screens must use these EXACT color assignments:**
    - Background: PRIMARY_BG (same across all screens)
    - Active tab/button/selected state: ACCENT_COLOR (same across all screens)
    - Inactive tab/unselected state: MUTED_COLOR (same across all screens)
    - Primary action buttons: ACCENT_COLOR (same across all screens)
    - Text: TEXT_COLOR (same across all screens)

    **BOTTOM NAVIGATION CONSISTENCY (CRITICAL):**
    - ALL screens must show the EXACT SAME navigation tabs in the SAME ORDER
    - Choose 4-5 relevant tab names for this app (e.g., "Home", "Journal", "Moods", "Insights", "Profile")
    - Specify which tab is ACTIVE on each screen (highlighted in ACCENT_COLOR)
    - All other tabs must be INACTIVE (shown in MUTED_COLOR)
    - Tab icon style must be identical across screens (same line weight, same icon design approach)

    **EXAMPLE PROMPTS WITH CONSISTENT COLORS AND UI DESIGN SYSTEM:**

COLOR PALETTE: Soft sage green (#E8F2E8), warm cream (#F5E6D3), muted gold (#D4AF37), earthy white (#F5F1E8)"

    **UI DESIGN SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS:**

    Apply these consistent design system rules across ALL screens:

    ELEVATION & SHADOWS:
    - Cards: 4dp elevation (shadow: 0px 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), blur 8px, spread 0px)
    - Buttons (primary): 2dp elevation (shadow: 0px 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.16))
    - Buttons (active/pressed): 8dp elevation (shadow: 0px 4px 16px rgba(ACCENT_COLOR,0.24))
    - Modals/Overlays: 16dp elevation (shadow: 0px 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.20))
    - Use PRIMARY_BG color for all shadow colors at specified opacity

    CORNER RADIUS:
    - Buttons: 12px border-radius on all corners
    - Cards: 16px border-radius on all corners
    - Input fields: 8px border-radius
    - Modals: 24px border-radius (top corners only if bottom sheet)
    - Bottom navigation container: 0px (square, flush with edges)

    TYPOGRAPHY HIERARCHY:
    - Screen titles/headers: 28px font size, 700 weight (bold), letter-spacing -0.5px
    - Section headers: 20px font size, 600 weight (semibold)
    - Body text: 16px font size, 400 weight (regular), line-height 1.5
    - Labels/captions: 14px font size, 500 weight (medium)
    - Button text: 16px font size, 600 weight (semibold)
    - Tab labels: 12px font size, 500 weight (medium)

    LAYOUT GRID & SPACING:
    - Base spacing unit: 8px (use multiples: 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px)
    - Screen padding (left/right): 16px from edges
    - Screen padding (top): 16px below header
    - Card padding (internal): 16px all sides
    - Vertical gaps between cards: 12px
    - Button height: 48px (minimum touch target)
    - Input field height: 48px
    - Bottom navigation height: 72px (including safe area)
    - Header/top bar height: 56px

    ICON SYSTEM:
    - Icon size: 24px × 24px (navigation, buttons, inline icons)
    - Icon stroke weight: 2px (consistent across all icons)
    - Icon style: [outline style - NOT filled, unless active state]
    - Active nav icons: filled style in ACCENT_COLOR
    - Inactive nav icons: outline style in MUTED_COLOR

    COMPONENT IDENTITY LOCK (maintain across ALL screens):
    - Bottom navigation: EXACT same tab count, order, icons, spacing, heights
    - Header bar: EXACT same height, title positioning, back button style
    - Button style: EXACT same height, corner radius, font weight, padding
    - Card style: EXACT same corner radius, shadow, internal padding
    - All buttons of same type: EXACT same visual treatment

    **DESIGN CONSISTENCY:**
    - All screens MUST use the color theme EXACTLY as specified above
    - UI components of the same type MUST use the SAME color across all screens
    - Typography and font weights must be consistent across screens
    - Only the ACTIVE tab should change between screens - everything else stays the same
    - ALL elevation shadows must be subtle and appropriate to depth
    - ALL spacing must follow the 8px grid system

    **CRITICAL NEGATIVE PROMPTING (MUST AVOID):**

    NEVER include these elements:
    - ❌ Device bezels, phone frames, screen borders, rounded screen corners
    - ❌ Home indicator bar at bottom (this is iPhone X+ UI, not the screen content)
    - ❌ Background padding, margins, or vignette effects around the screen
    - ❌ Mockup presentation style (floating screen, drop shadows on device)
    - ❌ Background extending beyond the viewport edges
    - ❌ Photorealistic effects: lens blur, depth of field, camera grain, lens flare
    - ❌ Inconsistent corner radius across similar components
    - ❌ Mixed icon styles (some filled, some outline) on same screen
    - ❌ Text truncation with "..." unless intentional overflow
    - ❌ Misaligned elements, uneven spacing, off-grid positioning
    - ❌ Low-contrast text (ensure WCAG AA minimum: 4.5:1 for body text)
    - ❌ Pixelated icons, blurry text, compression artifacts

    ENSURE canvas filling:
    - ✅ Status bar touches absolute top edge (0px from top)
    - ✅ Content extends to left edge (0px from left)
    - ✅ Content extends to right edge (0px from right)
    - ✅ Bottom navigation touches absolute bottom edge (0px from bottom)
    - ✅ Background color fills entire canvas with NO surrounding space
